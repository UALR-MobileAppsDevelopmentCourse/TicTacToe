# ticTacToe

A simple tic tac toe app, to illustrate the use of MVC, MVP, and MVVM architectures to organize the application.

The master branch contains just the model - The brains & state of the tic tac toe game.

Other branches contain the model, plus a User Interface following:
* *mvc* - Is an example of using Model View Controller to model the UI / Model Interaction.
* *mvp* - Example of Model View Presenter
* *mvvm* - Example of Model View ViewModel with Databinding 

#### Notes
 
* It is intended to be a reference to show the concepts of MVC, MVVM, and MVP on Android.  

* This project is based on the work of ericmaxwell2003: https://github.com/irconde/TicTacToe/commits?author=ericmaxwell2003

**I hope this project/post is useful to you!   Thank you for reading.**
